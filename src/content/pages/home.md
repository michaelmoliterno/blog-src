My name is Michael Moliterno, and I like to look for patterns and insights in data to solve real problems. 

See the link above for my CV/résumé.  See the other link above for blog posts about my past work. 

Feel free to connect with me (links to the left) or clone/fork any code from my GitHub repositories.
