Summary: [NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com) is a very cool initiative that makes the wealth of public data generated by various New York City agencies/organizations available for public use. One of these data sets is MTA Turnstile data, which details entrances and exits for every turnstile in the NYC Subway system.  For this project, I ingested the raw turnstile data text files, cleaned/organized the data into Python dictionaries, then performed exporatory analysis on a few weeks worth of turnstile data. 






## Introduction
[NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com) is a very cool initiative that makes the wealth of public data generated by various New York City agencies/organizations available for public use. One of these data sets is MTA Turnstile data, which details entrances and exits for every turnstile in the NYC Subway system. For this project, I ingested the raw turnstile data text files, cleaned/organized the data into Python dictionaries, then performed exporatory analysis on a few weeks worth of turnstile data. 

See here for an [IPyton Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/michaelmoliterno/metis-projects/blob/master/benson/Benson_Complete.ipynb) that details the analysis discussed below. 

See here for the [github source](https://github.com/michaelmoliterno/metis-projects/tree/master/benson) with the above IPython Notebook, helper functions, and sample MTA turnstile data.
